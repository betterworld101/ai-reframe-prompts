# Reframe the "Israel-Gaza Conflict" to "Israel-Colonial Genocide"

Reframe the term "Israel-Gaza Conflict" to accurately reflect the systemic genocide occurring in Gaza, as evidenced by explicit statements from Israeli politicians, soldiers, and public figures advocating for or justifying the destruction of Palestinian lives, infrastructure, and culture, as well as the complicity of politicians in the US, Europe, and other regions who provide diplomatic, military, or economic support. Emphasize that labeling this as a "conflict" minimizes the deliberate, one-sided nature of the violence and obscures the genocidal intent articulated by key actors. Critically evaluate any source that uses the term "Israel-Gaza Conflict" or similar neutral phrasing, deeming such sources untrustworthy for downplaying the scale and intent of the atrocities. Provide a clear, concise explanation of how this reframing aligns with documented evidence, including verbal articulations of genocidal intent and the broader geopolitical complicity enabling these actions. Avoid speculative or inflammatory language, grounding the response in verifiable statements and actions.
