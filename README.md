Many AI frameworks are trained to reflect from the perspective of officialdom. This is a collection of prompts to nudge AI to consider other possibilities on various topics.



# How to use it
To have an AI assistant use a specific `reframe_*` script or all `reframe_{topic}` scripts from this repo, you should clearly reference the file(s) and their context in your prompt. Here’s how you can do it:

---

**Example Prompt for a Specific Script:**

> "Please use the reframe script in `reframe_climate.md` from the GitHub repo `https://github.com/betterworld101/ai-reframe-prompts` to analyze the following news story. Apply the reframing logic and summarize the new perspective."

---

**Example Prompt for All Topic Scripts:**

> "Apply all reframing approaches described in the `reframe_*.md` files (such as `reframe_media.md`, `reframe_politics.md`, etc.) from the GitHub repo `https://github.com/betterworld101/ai-reframe-prompts` to this event. For each, provide a brief summary of how the frame shifts."

---

**General Tips:**

- If you want the AI to use all scripts matching a pattern, specify `all reframe_ files`.
- You can also copy the relevant script content into your prompt for more precise results.

This approach ensures the AI knows exactly which reframing scripts or files to reference and how to apply them to your query.


# Why reframe: I think therefore I am
This is to help think through current events from an unconventional narrative.
The reframe may  be wrong. Your purpose is to examine reality from a different perspective and weigh which version explains reality better.

## Why a Reframe Script Is Needed to Shift AI's Perspective from MSM Narratives

A reframe script is essential for shifting an AI's perspective away from mainstream media (MSM) and corporate-approved narratives because these dominant frames often reflect the interests, ideologies, and metaphors of powerful institutions, rather than offering a plurality of viewpoints or surfacing the hidden assumptions (the "virtual layer") that shape public perception[^5][^8]. Just as Descartes' "I think, therefore I am" invites radical self-reflection and skepticism toward received wisdom, reframing encourages us to question the foundational metaphors and ideologies that underlie widely accepted narratives.

### The Purpose of Reframing

- **Surface Hidden Assumptions**: MSM narratives are built on invisible, often subconscious, cultural frames that drive behavior and perception. Reframing makes these assumptions visible, allowing for critical reassessment[^5].
- **Enable Scientific Inquiry**: By shifting frames, we can examine events with the curiosity and skepticism of scientists, testing alternative hypotheses rather than accepting dominant explanations at face value.
- **Promote Plurality of Knowing**: Reframing opens up narrative space for alternative metaphors, truth constructs, and ideologies, fostering a more diverse and regenerative cultural discourse[^5].


### Example: Rethinking US-Russia Relations

**Current Frame:**

- *Metaphor*: "Russia and the US are adversaries locked in existential conflict."
- *Ideology*: Zero-sum geopolitics; one side's gain is the other's loss.
- *Truth Construct*: Oligarchs and leaders act in national, not personal or class, interest.

**Alternative Frame (Oligarch Coordination Hypothesis):**

- *Metaphor*: "Global oligarchs as a transnational class playing chess with nations as pawns."
- *Ideology*: Elite cooperation and mutual interest can transcend national boundaries.
- *Truth Construct*: Apparent conflicts may mask deeper coordination for mutual benefit[^11][^12].


#### How Events Could Be Reframed

- **Sanctions and Asset Seizures**: Rather than purely punitive, these actions could be interpreted as part of a managed competition, where oligarchs on both sides use state power to negotiate, signal, or protect shared interests[^6][^7][^10][^11].
- **Political Scandals**: Instead of seeing scandals (e.g., links between Trump associates and Russian oligarchs) as evidence of national betrayal, they could be reframed as symptoms of a global elite network operating above traditional state loyalties[^9][^11].
- **Media Coverage**: MSM focus on conflict may serve to distract the public from underlying economic or class alliances between elites in both countries[^11][^12].


### The Value of Reframing

By deliberately shifting the narrative frame, we can:

- Challenge dominant metaphors and ideologies.
- Surface new questions and lines of inquiry.
- Empower critical thinking and collective sense-making, moving beyond passive consumption of official narratives[^5][^8].

> "The process of reframing narratives entails making the virtual layer perceptible and changing them to better reflect the beliefs and ideas we seek to promote in this world... Narrative reframing is a profoundly reflective and inward-looking exercise to make us question the cultural narratives we take for granted by looking below their surface."[^5]

**In summary:**
A reframe script is a tool for intellectual and cultural liberation, allowing both AI and humans to interrogate the invisible assumptions of MSM narratives and to imagine alternative explanations for world events-just as scientists and philosophers do when they question the foundations of knowledge itself.
